Yoga pose detection and correction using computer vision

The fundamental goal of Yoga pose detection and correction is to provide standard yoga poses and help the user to correct their poses with the help of real-time feedback. This proposed tool can assist the user in practicing nine different yoga poses using computer vision, it analyzes the human poses, detects and corrects the user, ensuring a healthier lifestyle, and promotes well-being for people belonging to all age groups. This application provides a user-friendly environment that benefits users in the process of yoga learning and practice. Live webcams are used to detect the pose of the user and display the name of the Asana with accuracy. Corrections in angles would be mentioned and highlighted. This provides the user a choice to choose from i.e. Demo and Practice where a learning pathway consisting of several Asanas in the right order is accessible to the user and the detection of yoga poses is also available. The history of learned and practiced Asanas are maintained and displayed to the user.
